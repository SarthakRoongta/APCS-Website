And now, a bit about me, my brag sheet: 

I am a black belt in taekwondo, and I've been doing it for about 9 years. It is something that I am very passionate about, and love doing.

I also teach at the same place I go to taekwondo. It is a really interesting experience because I get to teach people with the knowledge that I've built up over a long period of time and experience that I've built up over a long time. 

Something interesting about me is that I love the Pok√©mon franchise, have played every game, and can name pretty much every pokemon up until the 8th generation, if prompted with some sort of description.

I also used be an ice skater!
